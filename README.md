## INSTRUCTIONS:
#################################################
1. Built specifically in pygame using python.
2. To start the game run, 'python DonkeyMain.py'
3. To create a new level just create a new level file of format **levelX.py** where X is the level no (ex. 1,2,43,45) with no leading extra zeroes. The code would take care of the rest.
4. 3 levels are already added with increasing difficulty. You can freely alter the level design by editing the level files.


## Controls:
---
`q` =	Quit Game  
`w`	=	Move Up(climb)  
`a`	=	Move Left  
`d`	=	Move right  
`s`	=	Move down  
`Space`	=	Jump  



## GOAL:
---
The player has to avoid all the falling fireballs and avoid the **MONSTER**, and reach the cup.  
Once touching it, you would be promoted to next level. YEAH !!  



## SCORING:
---
- There is a score of `5` for each coin, which gets added in the total score.  
- There are a total of `3 lives`. Each death costs 1 life.  
- There are a total of `3 levels as of now`. New levels can be added by just placing the file **levelX.py**, no need to alter the code.
